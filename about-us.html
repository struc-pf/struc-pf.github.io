							<h1>About Us</h1>
							<p>At Struc, we understand the struggles of scattered data, unclear metrics, and uncertainty about where to start.
								Many organisations, even big corporations, face these challenges. Despite abundant online resources, taking that first step remains tough. 
								Moreover, many consultancy solutions assume a certain level of existing data infrastructure and specific skills to maintain
								the solution effectively. We acknowledge the significant gap between the fast-moving tech world and 
								the day-to-day operations of SMEs and charities. We aim to bridge this gap and support you in tackling 
								open questions and achieving your data goals.
								<br><br>
								Working closely with your leadership and operational teams, we derive insightful conclusions that inform crucial decisions.
								Our expertise lies in establishing new input and reporting systems, 
								drive growth through data analysis, and refining metrics to match your team's skills. 
								Beyond improvements, we optimise existing systems and data processes while providing essential training materials.
								<br><br>
								We welcome collaborations with IT companies, aiming to enhance data capacity through strategic partnerships. 
								We specialise in translating business requirements into technical specifications, ensuring seamless alignment and driving transformative results.

								<br>
								Hi there! I'm Priscilla, an experienced data professional dedicated to helping businesses 
								and individuals navigate the ever-changing field of data. With a wealth of experience in 
								the data realm, I've honed my skills in scoping out data needs, creating automation tools, 
								crafting visualisation, performing analytics, and designing models to drive informed decision-making.
								<br><br>
								Throughout my career, one thing has remained constant â€” I have always sought ways to drive change. 
								Whether it was automating manual reports or advocating for the availability of missing data, 
								I naturally became the person in the team championing better data and analytical capabilities. 
								What truly brings me joy is meeting people from all walks of life, understanding their unique challenges, 
								and following through with ideas that matter to them. 
								<br><br>
								My journey in the data field has been one of curiosity and continuous learning. 
								I firmly believe that data should be accessible to everyone, and my goal is to 
								demystify its complexities for you. Feel free to reach out at 
								<a href="mailto:priscilla.fung@struc.co.uk ?subject=Query">priscilla.fung@struc.co.uk</a>
								 or on 
								<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/priscilla-hoi-lam-fung/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>
								 , and I am eager to guide you on your data journey!
