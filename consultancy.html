							<p>Does this sound familiar?</p>
							<p style="margin-left: 40px;"><em>- Our data is scattered across numerous spreadsheets, various third-party systems, and even some on paper!</em><br>
							<em>- Things seem to be going well, but I need better data to apply for funding or to reassure my investors!</em><br>
							<em>- I know we need to sort out our data but we donâ€™t know where to start!</em></p>
							<p>We understand the struggles of scattered data, unclear metrics, and uncertainty about where to start.
								Many organisations, even big corporations, face these challenges. Despite abundant online resources, taking that first step remains tough. 
								Moreover, many consultancy solutions assume a certain level of existing data infrastructure and specific skills to maintain
								the solution effectively. We acknowledge the significant gap between the fast-moving tech world and 
								the day-to-day operations of SMEs and charities. Our mission is to bridge this gap and support you in tackling 
								open questions and achieving your data goals.
								<br><br>
								Collaborating closely with your CEO, MD, and operational staff, we delve into drawing insightful conclusions 
								that underpin your decisions. Whether you're optimising data input procedures to improve efficiency or undertaking data-driven initiatives 
								aimed at being better informed for funding and grant applications, we can support that. With our expertise, we assist in establishing new 
								inputting and reporting systems and drive growth through data analysis. We shape metrics, refine tracking methods, and ensure data quality, 
								crafting plans that align with your team's skills. Our role covers not only enhancements but also optimising existing systems and data entry processes, 
								all while delivering vital training materials.
								<br><br>
								We also welcome IT companies to get in touch. We're thrilled to forge partnerships, leveraging our 
								expertise to enhance the training and scoping of data capacity for their customers. We specialise in 
								translating business requirements into technical specifications, ensuring seamless alignment and driving transformative results.
